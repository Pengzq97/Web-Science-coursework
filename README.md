1.The stream_tweets.py is the crawler file

2.the process_tweets.ipynb is the file used for processing the tweets and generate the CSV files 

3.The sample_data only contains 'happy' class data and can run successfully in the process_tweets.ipynb

4.The data for uploading and the data for crowdsourcing is the result of this coursework, I upload these just in case the review may need it 

if you have any problems in running the files, please contact me at: 2451445p@student.gla.ac.uk
